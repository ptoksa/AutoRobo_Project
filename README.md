# AutoRobo Project
Many of the work processes and tasks demand great precision, error-free operations and high quality outcomes. Humans are not at their best in these actions. Due to this human frailty, a lot of duties can be assigned to be carried out by automatized platforms. Healthcare and hospice operations retain processes which can be assisted by mobile robots. The service architecture model developed in Tampere University, Pori, consists of a novel mobile cloud robotic platform in the support of patient work. The ecosystem, OpenCRP, holds an open-source cloud-computing platform, software frameworks and a physical multi-robot environment for the automation or assisting of preprogrammed work processes.
## Goal
Mobile robots with service-oriented functions are stepping to our lives in hospitals, hospices and industries where robots can help to assist or perform all the arduous working duties. Many laborious processes can be identified and automatized, e.g. in hospital medicine delivery and food servery to ward for patients. The service architecture model presents a pilot and demonstration environment for multiple open-source mobile robots sharing their collected data with each other via a private cloud. In addition, the presented platform introduces a novel ecosystem based on an open-source software frameworks and robots.
