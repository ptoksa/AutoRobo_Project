# AutoRobo Project
Many of the work processes and tasks demand great precision, error-free operations and high quality outcomes. Humans are not at their best in these actions. Due to this human frailty, a lot of duties can be assigned to be carried out by automatized platforms. Healthcare and hospice operations retain processes which can be assisted by mobile robots. The service architecture model developed in Tampere University, Pori, consists of a novel mobile cloud robotic platform in the support of patient work. The ecosystem, OpenCRP, holds an open-source cloud-computing platform, software frameworks and a physical multi-robot environment for the automation or assisting of preprogrammed work processes.
